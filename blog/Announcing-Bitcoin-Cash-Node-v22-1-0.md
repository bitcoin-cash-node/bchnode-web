### Release announcement: Bitcoin Cash Node v22.1.0

The Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) project is pleased to announce its minor release version 22.1.0.

This release implements some interface enhancements and includes a number of corrections and improvements. Interface changes are fully backward compatible and require no adaptation of other systems.

Two new testing networks have been added: testnet4 which is optimized for faster synchronization than the existing testnet3, and scalenet which lays the groundwork for testing much higher throughputs and blocksizes.

Users who are running any of our previous releases are recommended to upgrade to v22.1.0 ahead of the BCH network upgrade on November 15, 2020.

We remind that the older 0.21.x family of BCHN releases does not implement the new rules for the coming November upgrade. Users must upgrade to arelease in the 22.x family before November 15, 2020.
