                    <p>This is the first of a series of <a href="https://bitcoincashnode.org/">Bitcoin Cash Node</a> project announcement posts that will outline our plans for 2020, both in the short term (May) and looking ahead a bit further (November).</p>
                    <p>Bitcoin Cash Node is intended for professional use by mining pools, exchanges and other businesses with mission-critical infrastructure building on Bitcoin Cash (BCH).</p>
                    <p>In March, we intend to release a series of further announcements with more focused information aimed specifically at these key user groups. The following general announcement is addressed to all prospective Bitcoin Cash Node users.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3 id="upcoming-bitcoin-cash-upgrade-on-15-may-2020">Upcoming Bitcoin Cash upgrade on 15 May 2020</h3>
                    <figure class="text-center">

                    </figure>

                    <p>For the coming upgrade on 15 May 2020, Bitcoin Cash Node will provide:</p>
                    <blockquote>

                        "<em>a safe and professional node implementation that will neutrally follow the longest chain without contributing to the risk of a chain split</em>" > - <a href="https://read.cash/@freetrader/bitcoin-cash-node-003b2381">original Bitcoin Cash Node release announcement, February 20, 2020</a>

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>To recap, we implement the <code class="language-javascript">OP_REVERSEBYTES</code> and SigChecks features of the Bitcoin Cash network upgrade which were <a href="https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/pull/444/commits/98d79b6ad7a23e5aafab1dffd570388400c5e210">specified at the cut-off date of 15 Feb 2020</a>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/2020-05-15-op_reversebytes.md">OP_REVERSEBYTES</a> specification</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/2020-05-15-sigchecks.md">SigChecks</a> specification</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Our node is constructed to safely follow the longest chain during the upgrade, by accepting blocks regardless of whether they vote for the IFP or not.</p>
                    <p>The client does not include any rule activation based on BIP9 or similar voting. Re-org protection remains included and configured with the same default values as the ABC client.</p>
                    <p>We intend to make no further changes that require consensus for May, but focus on reducing defects and improving performance, stability and user-friendliness until then. It is likely that we will issue an <em>optional</em> minor release
                        providing such enhancements before May.</p>
                    <p>Generally, we commit to providing stable interfaces across major releases.</p>

                    <p>Our team includes a number of seasoned Bitcoin professionals, including software developers with many years of experience, who are committed to delivering a C++ node software that is suitable for the most demanding business environments
                        (mining, pools, exchanges) yet can also be set up with minimal effort by novice Bitcoin Cash users.</p>
                    <p><strong>Our project has requested to conduct an Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) session on the popular Reddit forum /r/btc later this week</strong>, where our <a href="https://read.cash/@freetrader/">lead developer</a> and other team members will
                        be on hand to answer your questions about the project and how we see the future of Bitcoin Cash.</p>

                    <p>Since the software launch on 27 February 2020, the team has set up an efficient Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline and has begun reviewing the existing <a href="https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/53">code quality checks</a> so
                        that they can be substantially refined and tightened as development proceeds.</p>
                    <p>The lead developer is pursuing the use of additional static analysis tools to reduce the risk of software defects. We will keep you informed about developments in that regard in subsequent posts.</p>
                    <p>Since the scope for the May release has been decided, the Bitcoin Cash Node team is now focusing on the following items:</p>
                    <p><strong><u>Software development side</u></strong>
                    </p>

                            <p>Completing the missing specification of the automatic finalization feature (aka "rolling checkpoints") introduced by Bitcoin ABC - a <em>specification gap</em> which is consensus relevant and poses an obstacle to other client
                                implementation accessing the Bitcoin Cash mining arena</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>Putting in place a development process that is completely open and inviting to the public and new developers, testers and other professionals and hobbyists who want to help Bitcoin Cash Node. We believe in "<em>do not trust, verify</em>"

                                - at the moment backports occur at the discretion of our senior developers, and anyone can raise an issue on our <a href="https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/issues">Gitlab tracker</a> to request specific

                                general funding of operations, including personnel, equipment and contracting. We appreciate donations, but will also have further announcements on how we intend to participate in crowd-funding activities and potentially,
                                development sponsorship engagements with industry.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Defining further roles that the project seeks to establish, such as professional liaison with key users of our software and engagement with wider Bitcoin Cash user base. We intend to be responsive to the requirements of the
                                Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.</p>

                            <p>We are starting an evaluation to improve the difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA) in order to reduce variance of the block confirmation time. Much research has already been done in this field. We will not change DAA validation
                                rules in May. However, we want to proactively look at possible improvements that might be needed as long as Bitcoin Cash has a relatively low hashrate compared to BTC.</p>

                    <p>We plan to issue advice to pools, exchanges and other wallet users ahead of the Bitcoin Cash upgrade in May to recommend certain operational procedures including switchover and switchback for those who have been using Bitcoin ABC until
                        now and need to take operational steps to ensure a smooth upgrade.</p>

                    <p>Bitcoin Cash has established - through five successful upgrade cycles - that hard fork upgrades are valuable. Parts of the industry have communicated a desire to move to a more ecosystem-friendly schedule of a one-year upgrade cycle
                        that leaves more room for research and coordination.</p>
                    <p>The "automatic replay protection" feature that is currently active on the network in ABC clients forces another software update by 15 November 2020.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we intend to work together with all stakeholders to ensure a successful upgrade in November 2020 as well.</p>
                    <p>As ecosystem-wide decision processes are established, future schedules may need to be reassessed - many have expressed that the current semi-annual upgrade schedule creates difficulties in adoption and operational cost.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of low-contention improvements already suggested for the client software. We will be investigating the feasibility of these in collaboration with other teams.</p>
                    <p><strong>Consensus relevant</strong> (or quasi-consensus):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>UTXO commitments for faster synchronization of newly joined network nodes</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Script improvements (64 bit integers, perhaps <code class="language-javascript">op_txinfo</code>)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>DAA upgrade if evaluation results indicate that it is useful</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Resolving the unconfirmed transaction chain limits in a more permanent way than the current (May 2020) bump of defaults by a factor of two from 25 to 50.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Non-consensus work</strong> that Bitcoin Cash Node client implementation can progress independently:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Block propagation techniques for scaling (Graphene, Xthinner)</p>
